# Mobile App Development for Start-Ups 2019 Hackathon 
## Casual Earnings

The result of a two day hackathon in which we created a prototype mobile application for a startup company. The application includes iOS and Android projects. The iOS project involves a demonstration of the application's wage calculator functions whilst the Android demonstrates mainly what the app would look like as well as timer functionality. We won second place in the hackathon with the presentation we made, which is included in the files.
